			I am Than Sin Ko(aka)Rosie and I am currently attending at a school called EDUSN, I am interested in making website<br> abouts for foods, crochet, DIYS, health, and so on. I started coding when I was in year-4. The color choice I usually<br>
			use for my website are <b>pink, red, purple, blue and other pastel color</b>. I love using animation, and creative transition<br> in my website. For one website I would take around 10-25 dollars.
